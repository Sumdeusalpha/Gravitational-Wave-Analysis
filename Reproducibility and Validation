This repository is designed so that anyone can:

Clone the repo.

Install dependencies.

Run the script.

Regenerate:

Constant lattice counts.

Monte Carlo expectations.

Z / χ-like tables.

Classifier accuracies (including event-grouped splits).

Tolerance robustness tables.

The intent is to invite open validation and critique:

Physicists can check for instrument artifacts and selection effects.

Statisticians can probe the null models and multiple-testing issues.

Data scientists can rerun or extend the classifiers, test new architectures, or add more events.
